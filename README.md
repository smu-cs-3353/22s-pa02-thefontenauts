## The Problem
 

## Building and Running the Program
Step 1: Navigate to the Working Directory

In your command line, use cd statements to navigate to the folder generated by opening the zip file containing this program.

Step 2: Create a Build Folder

Enter ```mkdir build``` into the command line to create a new folder called *build* which will be used for building and eventually running the program. Enter the folder with ```cd build```.

Step 3: Configure the Build

Enter ```cmake ..``` into the command line to configure the build folder. This will generate all of the files needed to build and run this program.

Step 4: Build the Program

Enter ```cmake -â€“build .``` into the command line to build the program. This will create an executable file to run this program.

Step 5: Run the Program

Enter ```./PA02 input/``` to run the program. During our testing insertion sort took 5-10 hours to sort the 1 million datasets. If you would like to skip running insertion sort please enter ```./PA02 input/ -i``` to run the program.

## Analysis

### Generating Data

### Randomized vs Presorted vs Semisorted

### String vs Ints

### Large Datasets

### Upper Bounds

### Duplicates

### Best Algorithm
