## The Fontenauts - Wes Anderson and Ryan Schaefer

## The Problem
For this project we were tasked with implementing multiple algorithms to put pictures on a wall for an art gallery. The art gallery has provided dimensions for the display wall as well as their collection of paintings with dimensions and prices included. The art gallery asked us to find the ordering of paintings that puts the most value on the wall. The algorithms we implemented were a brute force algorithm to test all possible combinations of paintings, a highest price first algorithm to put paintings on the wall in price descending order, and a custom algorithm that runs faster than the brute force but puts more value on the wall than the highest price. 

## Building and Running the Program
Step 1: Navigate to the Working Directory

In your command line, use cd statements to navigate to the folder generated by opening the zip file containing this program.

Step 2: Create a Build Folder

Enter ***mkdir build*** into the command line to create a new folder called *build* which will be used for building and eventually running the program. Enter the folder with ***cd build***.

Step 3: Configure the Build

Enter ***cmake ..*** into the command line to configure the build folder. This will generate all of the files needed to build and run this program.

Step 4: Build the Program

Enter ***cmake -â€“build .*** into the command line to build the program. This will create an executable file to run this program.

Step 5: Run the Program

Enter ***./PA01_Art input/example.txt*** to run the program. Replace *example.txt* with the name of the input file that you wish to use. We have found that at datasets larger than 25 bruteforce takes a lot of memory and time. If you would like to opt out of running brute force on larger datasets please include ***-b*** as a 3rd command line argument.

Note: We have created several input files to choose from which can be found in the root *input* folder. If you would like to run your own dataset or run more of ours then you will need to move them into the *build/input* folder.
