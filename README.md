## The Problem
 

## Building and Running the Program
Step 1: Navigate to the Working Directory

In your command line, use cd statements to navigate to the folder generated by opening the zip file containing this program.

Step 2: Create a Build Folder

Enter ***mkdir build*** into the command line to create a new folder called *build* which will be used for building and eventually running the program. Enter the folder with ***cd build***.

Step 3: Configure the Build

Enter ***cmake ..*** into the command line to configure the build folder. This will generate all of the files needed to build and run this program.

Step 4: Build the Program

Enter ***cmake -â€“build .*** into the command line to build the program. This will create an executable file to run this program.

Step 5: Run the Program

Enter ***./PA01_Art input/example.txt*** to run the program. Replace *example.txt* with the name of the input file that you wish to use. We have found that at datasets larger than 25 bruteforce takes a lot of memory and time. If you would like to opt out of running brute force on larger datasets please include ***-b*** as a 3rd command line argument.

Note: We have created several input files to choose from which can be found in the root *input* folder. If you would like to run your own dataset or run more of ours then you will need to move them into the *build/input* folder.
